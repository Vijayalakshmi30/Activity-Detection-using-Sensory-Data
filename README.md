# Activity-Detection-using-Sensory-Data
This project involves a large dataset comprising sensory data from 10 volunteers. With over 100,000 rows and 24 columns per subject, the goal is to classify 12 different activities and a null activity. After thorough experimentation, the Random Forest Model and Multilayer Perceptron model have demonstrated superior performance.
